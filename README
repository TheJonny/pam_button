Hack to avoid entering passwords into sudo
instead press a configured button.

the keyboard input is read from a /dev/input/... like file, so programs running
as user should not be able to generate the event.

something like this should be part of sudo, not a pam module.

installation:
make install

usage: use a line like this in /etc/pam.d/sudo
auth sufficient pam_button.so event_device=/dev/input/by-path/platform-thinkpad_acpi-event lockfile=/run/pam_button.lock keycode=148

use evtest to choose the right event_device and keycode.
